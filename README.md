# Phase-1-Project
We thought it would be very fitting, to do a rating bootcamp webpage, being as though we are in a bootcamp. This project allows the users to find possible bootcamps or maybe even a bootcamp that they have already attended. They will be able to see our provided rating of each bootcamp, along with real comments from other users. It wouldn't be fair if you could just look at commments, so we maybe it possible for every user to leave their own personal comment from their experience, that will stay saved on our webpage. Writing this webpage, we know that we do not have every coding bootcamp available on the page by default, so we want to allow the user to add a bootcamp of their choice that may not already appear on our site. This user will have to provide: the bootcamp name, an image of the bootcamp, their personal rating and their comment regarding their experience. Adding a bootcamp to our site will stay, and be live for every user to see and make comments on what school you added. With every bootcamp you see on our page, at the very top in the nav bar, you will find every bootcamps name that is a link to each schools website. Last but not least, we attached our social media acoounts on the left side of the page, your founders Zina and Shareif
